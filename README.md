# Daniil-Zaikin-2504-2021-PROJECT3

Good evening. My name is Dan Zaikin, and this is [Project 3](https://courses.smp.uq.edu.au/MATH2504/assessment_html/project3.html).

This code includes both the original and processed data, but should you wish to process your own set, you can do so by running `cleanup.jl`. Note that it includes `info`, `debug`, and `error` messages; you can enable or disable them as per standard Julia fare.
